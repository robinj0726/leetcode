## Time Complexity O(n log n)
The time complexity of the `findContentChildren` function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the longer list between `g` and `s`.

The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting operation on the lists `g` and `s`. In Python, the built-in `sort` function uses a sorting algorithm called Timsort, which has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n log n).

After sorting, the function performs a single pass through the lists using a while loop. This operation has a linear time complexity of O(n), but it's overshadowed by the O(n log n) complexity of the sorting operation.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n log n).

## Space Complexity O(1)

The space complexity of the `findContentChildren` function is O(1), which means it uses constant space.

The reason for this is that the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables `satisfied` and `cookie`, regardless of the size of the input lists `g` and `s`. 

The sorting operations are done in-place, meaning they do not require additional space that scales with the size of the input. 

Therefore, the space complexity is constant. Note that this analysis assumes that the space used for the input lists is not counted towards the space complexity, as is common in complexity analysis. If the space for the input lists is counted, then the space complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the longer list between `g` and `s`.
