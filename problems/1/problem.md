# Problem 1: Two Sum

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
Output: `[0,1]`
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, the indices of the two numbers are 0 and 1.

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.
