This Python function, `threeSum(nums)`, is designed to find all unique triplets in the array `nums` that add up to zero. 

The function starts by sorting the input list `nums` in ascending order. This is done to make it easier to avoid duplicate triplets and to control the movement of pointers in the later part of the function.

An empty list `triplets` is initialized to store the resulting triplets.

The function then iterates over each element in `nums` using a `for` loop, considering each element as the first element of a potential triplet. The range of the loop is `len(nums) - 2` because for each potential triplet, we need to consider the current element and at least two elements after it.

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element is the same as the previous one. If it is, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any processing for this element. This is done to avoid duplicate triplets.

Next, two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized. `left` is set to the index immediately after `i`, and `right` is set to the last index of `nums`. These pointers will be used to find the other two elements of the triplet.

The function then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`. Inside this loop, the function calculates the sum of the elements at the current `i`, `left`, and `right` indices.

If the sum is zero, it means a valid triplet is found. The triplet is appended to the `triplets` list. Then, the function skips any duplicate elements by moving the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left as long as the next element is the same as the current one. After that, the `left` and `right` pointers are moved towards the center to continue the search for other triplets.

If the sum is less than zero, the `left` pointer is moved to the right. This is because the array is sorted, and moving the `left` pointer to the right will increase the sum.

If the sum is greater than zero, the `right` pointer is moved to the left. This is because moving the `right` pointer to the left will decrease the sum.

After all iterations are done, the function returns the `triplets` list, which contains all unique triplets in `nums` that add up to zero.

The time complexity of the `threeSum` function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have nested loops that iterate through the array, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

The space complexity of the `threeSum` function is O(log n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we sort the array in place, which takes O(log n) space.

The `threeSum` function takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of lists containing all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. If no such triplets are found, an empty list is returned.
