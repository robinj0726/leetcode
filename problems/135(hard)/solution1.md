The `candy` problem on LeetCode (problem 135) is about distributing candies to children. Each child must get at least one candy, and children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. The goal is to distribute the candies with the minimum total number.

A common solution to this problem involves two passes through the ratings array: one from left to right and another from right to left. In the first pass, if a child has a higher rating than the previous child, the child gets one more candy than the previous child. In the second pass, if a child has a higher rating than the next child and fewer candies than the next child, the child gets as many candies as the next child plus one.

Here is a Python implementation of this solution:

```python
def candy(ratings):
    candies = [1] * len(ratings)
    for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
    for i in range(len(ratings) - 2, -1, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1
    return sum(candies)
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of children (or the length of the ratings array). This is because the solution involves two passes through the ratings array, and each pass takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

The space complexity is also O(n), because an additional array of size n is used to store the number of candies for each child.
