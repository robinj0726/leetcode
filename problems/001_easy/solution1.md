The `twoSum` problem is a common interview question. The problem statement is usually as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

Here is a common solution using a hash map (dictionary in Python):

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []
```

This function works by iterating over the list of numbers. For each number, it calculates the "complement" (the value that, when added to the current number, equals the target). It then checks if this complement is in the `num_map` dictionary. If it is, it means we have found two numbers that add up to the target, and we return their indices.

If the complement is not in the dictionary, it means we haven't encountered the necessary number to complete the pair that adds up to the target. In this case, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary and continue to the next iteration.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we perform a single pass through the list, and dictionary operations (checking if an element is in the dictionary and adding an element to the dictionary) are generally O(1).

The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, we will store every element from the list in the dictionary.
