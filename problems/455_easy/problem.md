## Problem 455: Assign Cookies

You are given two integer arrays `g` and `s`, where `g[i]` is the greed factor of the `i-th` child, and `s[j]` is the size of the `j-th` cookie. You have a certain number of cookies, where `cookies[j]` is the size of the `j-th` cookie. Each child wants at most one cookie.

You need to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example 1:**
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1

**Example 2:**
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
